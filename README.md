# Project Description
This project aims to detect the presence of COVID-19 disease from X-ray radiographs. A convolutional neural network was designed and trained to accurately detect the presence of the disease in the X-ray images.

Additionally, transfer learning was employed using the pre-trained ResNet 50 model, which helped to increase the accuracy of the model. The accuracy of the model was recorded and can be used to classify new X-ray images and detect the presence of COVID-19.

The project utilizes machine learning techniques and deep learning to develop a model that can accurately detect COVID-19 disease from X-ray images. The project serves as a demonstration of how machine learning can be used to diagnose medical conditions and improve patient outcomes.

The code and trained models in this project can be used as a starting point for further research and development of AI systems for diagnosing COVID-19 and other medical conditions.
